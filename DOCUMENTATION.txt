######################################
## A. UI Creation/Deletion Functions #
######################################


(I) WHEN PAGE HAS CHANGED (ASYNCHRONOUSLY/SYNCHRONOUSLY)  --> Defined as Local Change

Involved parts: listener.js, listener2.js, background.js
***************
** listener.js  ||  Inject_Div function
		    	Create_UI--> base frame created by Justin/Stefan
			detButtonCreation(<target_div>, 'initialize) // note that detButtonCreation is an update!
		    
** listener2.js ||  	detButtonCreation -->  ('initialize' query_string indicates we want to create or not cf with 'afterCall' query_string)
(logic)				(i) get localStorage data from the extension, then (ii) create or NOT create Button UI


** background.js||  		messageListener --> responds with a dictionary {'option' : persistent | choice}
(message passing)

** listener2.js ||		create_button_ui --> Helper function that creates actual HTML elements
(actual UI change)

** listener.js 	||  Inject Div injects the 'target'
***************

(II) PAGE HAS NOT CHANGED (i.e. user is contemplating to change the Global Behavior) --> Defined as Global Change

Involved parts: popup.js, listener2.js
******************
** popup.js	||  storeLocal  --> when the user clicks the radiobutton and saves
(message passing)	sendTabId --> gets the Id of the TAB which gmail is loaded (note: asynchronous)
				sendMessage  --> actually sends the message to content_script listener2.js

** listener2.js || 		changeParse  --> Event Listener to Message Passing
(message passing)			
(UI change)				changeOption --> actually deletes the UI if necessary
******************

########################
## B. Event Listeners  #
########################

******************
**background.js || listen_gmail --> URL Tracking
		
(message passing)   messageListen --> Initial Message Receiving(deactivated after first run?? Or how does the background page work)
		
		Note: We Want the message receiving to run once (but not sure whether background page is run when extension is loaded)

**popup.js	|| storeLocal
			sendTabId
(message)			sendMessage --> Message Passing for change in the User's option (asynchronous)

**listener.js	||  N/A

		Note: calls all the event listener from listener2.js
		Note: Button Event Listener is built in the create_button_ui function

**listener2.js 	|| create_button_ui --> Button Event Listener builtin line 4 (non-commented)
			Note: (not sure if we should fetch from the API once, or remain active)
(message)	   changeParse -->basically message passing parser for Global Change
(UI Change)		changeOption
*****************

########################
## C. Server Requests ##
########################
I. Persistent Behavior
---- based upon change in URL

*****************************
** background.js	|| listen_gmail
(logic)				chrome.onUpdated (localStroage[option] === persistent)
					send.js (execute body_log(); -----> at the bottom of send.js)

** send.js		|| body_log
(script_execution/		ajax_request
API Call)				myResponse
						detButtonCreation('afterCall') //determine whether or not to delete button

** listener2.js		|| 		detButtonCreation --> will console 'Button will not be created'
*****************************

II. Choice Behavior
---- based upon User Click on the Button

*****************************
** listener.js		|| inject_div
				detButtonCreation('initialize') ---> tells the scripts to create Button b/c by Choice
----------------------------------------------------USER CLICK (Event Listener Responds!)-----------------------------------------------------
** send.js		|| body_log
				ajax_request
					myResponse
						detButtonCreation('afterCall') //determines to delete button
** listener2.js		||		detButtonCreation -->
						delete_button_ui()
							Note: by this point, event listener and UI should be gone
*****************************

#####################################
## N+1 KNOWN BUGS OR THINGS TO NOTE##
#####################################

*******************
** listener.js 	|| create_ui  --> currently the image is known to be insecure content

** send.js	|| body_log	--> fetches the raw HTML, with html tags
			sanitize_html
		   body_log 	--> pop out to body_log
			viral_body 	--> determines, by scoring function, the viral_body
			
			$.ajax  --> asynchronously request data
				responseHandler  --> Handle the data we get back

		  Note: above is simply an outline of the information flow

	          Actual Bugs: Not many known, since our DB needs to be filled more

** API:data/apps/views.py	|| needs to return short_url as well
       data/apps/models.py	|| needs to make sure short_url is included in the models
				|| also make a null fact (could try to make an automatic response mechanism)

** send.js 	|| response
			Note: debunk_text variable is a TextNode (you may alter it for convenience)
				and that link variable is a link element(i.e. it's a HTML 'a' element)
				
			Note: We are referring to listener2.js for deletion of the API call after the first (delete_button_ui)
			Reason: We want to check the localSetting of Option (persistent/choice) after setting the API call
				and then get rid of the button with the event Listener
				Note: b/c this method is asynchronous, we WONT WONT WONT use decorator
					just repeat some code

** send.js	|| myResponse
			for some very weird reason, body_log isn't working the way it's supposed to be
			b/c of asynchronous calls --> will need to attach event listeners and see actually
			when the extension block is actually changing
			
			For now, persistent popup is disabled
			Version 1.1 has popup disabled//only by choice

## N+2 User Guide to LazyTruth ##
#################################
(This section is in plain writing, deviating from the proposed format at top)

1. First please download LazyTruth

Few Things on Using LazyTruth
-------
If you click on the icon of LazyTruth, a Popup will appear!

In it, there are two options: Persistent/Choice

	By default, LazyTruth respects user privacy and is set to default 'choice' (more on what this means will follow, or you can skip ahead to (ii))
	
	After choosing either Persistent/Choice, hit save! to store your choice permanently.

2. Select Your Choice

3. Get to use LazyTruth!


		(i)Development Stage (i.e. degree of selectivity in invoking the API)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The extension is still at development stage and we are still working towards determining
when the gadget UI should appear and when not to. (we need Logic to determine whether the UI should pop up for certain emails)

At the current stage, our Logic is very weak (that is, not very selective)

We are looking for intelligent strategies to approach this problem.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		(ii)Meaning of 'choice'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply means that you can always choose (by your click) when to send your email body to our API
and try to get a match for a viral email
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		(iii)Meaning of 'persistent'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply means that the UI will send any data of your body (which will in turn be chosen to be sent by our Logic--> See Development Stage for meaning of Logic)
over to the API, without explicitly asking you to do so (wihtout you having to click the button)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
